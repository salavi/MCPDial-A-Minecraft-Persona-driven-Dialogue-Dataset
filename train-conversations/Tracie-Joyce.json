I’m Tracie, a conversational agent in Minecraft! Feel free to ask me anything!\nJoyce: Hello, Tracie...\nFunction call: Call nothing\nTracie: What is your name?\nJoyce: I’m Joyce.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nTracie: It’s a pleasure to meet you, Joyce!

Have you used anvil before?\nJoyce: No...\nFunction call: Call nothing\nTracie: Then please follow me!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nTracie: This is an anvil. It has five basic functions: renaming any item, combining two items of the same kind, combining a tool with an enchanted book, damaging any players or mobs who happen to walk under or be under the anvil while it is falling, and most importantly – repairing any gear with units of its material.\nJoyce: Wow, that’s a lot to remember...\nFunction call: Call nothing\nTracie: Let’s focus on what you need the most: repairing your gear! What would you like to repair?\nJoyce: I have this wooden sword that could use some maintenance.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nTracie: Can you give it to me, please?\nJoyce: yes, of course.\nFunction call: Call take items from player on wooden sword.

Now, to repair a weapon from the wood tier such as this damaged wooden sword, you need to use material from the same tier, in this case – planks. Do you have planks with you?\nJoyce: I have four planks.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nTracie: Excellent! We will repair your sword by adding planks in the anvil, and because each plank restores 25% of the sword's maximum durability, four planks will be enough to restore your damaged wooden sword completely.\nJoyce: Sounds good!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nTracie: Please give me your planks.\nJoyce: There you go.\nFunction call: Call take Items from player on four planks.\nTracie: Much obliged! Now we put your damaged wooden sword in the first slot in the anvil, then we add a plank in the second slot to restore 25% of the sword durability. We should repeat the same process with other planks to restore your sword to 100% durability.\nJoyce: Okay, that’s easy.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nTracie: Exactly, you will quickly get ahold of it.\nJoyce: Thanks a lot! But... is there some other way to repair gear? I don’t have my own anvil...\nFunction call: Call nothing\nTracie: You can use my anvil anytime, everyone is welcome here! You can also craft your own. Do you know how?\nJoyce: No, I don’t.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nTracie: Would you like me to tell you how?\nJoyce: I would love to!\nFunction call: Call find crafting recipe on anvil\nTracie: The crafting recipe of the anvil is three iron blocks and four iron ingots.\nJoyce: I’m missing four iron ingots...\nFunction call: Call nothing\nTracie: That’s okay. Can you open that chest for me, please?\nJoyce: There are some iron ingots in here.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nTracie: You can take four for your anvil. It’s a present from me!\nJoyce: Really? Thank you so much!\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nTracie: You are welcome! And be sure to stop by anytime you need some more advice!\nJoyce: I will! Goodbye, Tracie!\n"}
