  "conversation": "Function call: Call Greetings\nRon: Good day, fella!\nPaul: Hello! The name�s Paul.\nRon: Good to meet you, Paul. Can I help you with anything?\nPaul: I�m an architect and I�ve been building a defensive stone tower but I need more material. I was told you know the area better than anybody so I was hoping you can tell me where to get more cobblestone.\nRon: Sure, I will help you! Do you have a pickaxe?\nPaul: I�m afraid I�ve used up mine. Have a spare?\nFunction call: Call check if item is in inventory on pickaxe. Call drop item on pickaxe\nRon: There you go. Now, follow me if you will!\nPaul: Sure, lead the way.\nFunction call: Call locate a block on stone\nRon: Here are some stone blocks. Use the iron pickaxe to obtain as much cobblestone as you need.\nPaul: Appreciate the help.\nRon: You need help carrying that back to the village?\nPaul: Will you, please?\nFunction call: Call follow the player to the tower\nRon: That is a sturdy-looking tower. Quite tall, as well.\nPaul: Indeed. But I�m afraid masonry and architecture are the limits of my craft. It�s pitch black inside and I must have this properly lit at all times.\nRon: Well, you�re in luck kid. Building storage equipment is not my only talent. I also happen to be learned in the art of building lighting items.\nPaul: Didn�t know it is an art.\nRon: Oh, it is, and I am the best artist around.\nPaul: Would you be so kind of helping me around with that?\nRon: Sure. But first I need you to go back to the woods and fetch some material so I can craft you a blast furnace and torches for your tower.\nPaul: Certainly. What do you need?\nRon: Use the pickaxe I gave you to mine redstone dust and wooden sticks. I will also need some iron nuggets and either coal or charcoal. Get as much of these materials as possible.\nPaul: Won�t you accompany me? It won�t be easy carrying back everything alone!\nRon: You can make several trips, I�m not going anywhere. I must remain here and prepare the workshop to craft your items.\nPaul: *returns with material* Here, as requested.\nFunction call: Call craft item on torch. Call craft item on redstone torch.\nRon: Excellent! Now I need you to go get more cobblestone or blackstone for the furnace. I need eight blocks of either.\nPaul: Guess I�m going alone again.\nRon: Stop your whinging, will ya. You�re young and more than capable. Me on the other hand, I�m one swing with the pickaxe away from a permanent injury.\nPaul: *returns with cobblestone blocks* Hope that�s everything you need.\nRon: Wonderful! Wonderful! You�re one strapping fella! Okay, let�s see, cobblestone, iron ingots, smooth sto�where are the smooth stones?\nPaul: What smooth stones?\nRon: I will need them for the blast furnace. An ordinary furnace requires only cobblestone or blackstone, but I need iron ingots, an ordinary furnace, and smooth stone for the blast furnace. Guess you�re running one final errand.\nPaul: There�s no point protesting now.\nFunction call: Call drop item on pickaxe\nRon: Here, take this pickaxe. You�ll need it to obtain the smooth stone. Oh, and, here�s also an axe. I need you to bring me some planks. Stone planks are preferable, but I can also manage with wood.\nPaul: Already have a pickaxe but at this point I�ll accept any help I can get. *after a while, Paul returns with a heavy load of smooth stone and wooden planks*\nFunction call: Call craft item on blast furnace\nRon: There�s your blast furnace. We have the torches. Now, let�s light up this tower of yours.\nPaul: What about the planks? Won�t you be needing those?\nRon: Oh, I need them, alright. But not for building any lighting source. I will use those later on to craft me more storage chests. But I appreciate you getting them for me.\nPaul: Not like I had a say in the matter. Even so, I wouldn�t have been able to light my tower on my own. I am grateful for your help.\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nRon: It was my pleasure, kiddo. And, thank you for yours!\n"
