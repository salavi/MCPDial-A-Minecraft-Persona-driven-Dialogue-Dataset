My food bar keeps going down and I don’t know where to get food. But hunting should work, how do I hunt? You look like you are an expert at that, with your cute little wolf.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nSnorre: Yes, you can say I’m an expert. But my wolf is not cute nor little. To hunt you first need a weapon. I always suggest bow and arrow first. As you can keep your distance with it. But a sword will work as well.\nCamila: Can’t you just give me some food?\nSnorre: You know what they say, give someone food and you feed them for a day. Teach someone to hunt and you feed them for a lifetime.\nCamila: A bow and arrow sounds like totally amazing. But I don’t have one.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nSnorre: I can teach you how to make a bow.\nCamila: That would be like amazing! Please tell me.\nFunction call: Call Find crafting recipe on Bow\nSnorre: All we need is 3 sticks and a string and we can make you a bow.\nCamila: I have the sticks, but I don’t have any string. A hunter as good as you probably has some strings I can use?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nSnorre: Yes I do have some strings. If you give me the sticks I’ll make the bow for you.\nCamila: Here are the sticks.\nFunction call: Call take items from player on Sticks, Call Craft item on Bow. Call Drop item function on Bow.\nSnorre: Here is the bow you want. Do you happen to have arrows?\nCamila: No I don’t. Do you have them? Or how do I make them?\nFunction call: Call Find crafting recipe on Arrow\nSnorre: To make an arrow all we need is a flint, a stick and one feather. I do have the feather if you need to.\nCamila: Can you give me some feathers? So I can like make the arrows myself.\nFunction call: Call Drop item on Feather\nSnorre: Sure here you have three feathers. That should be enough to make about 12 arrows.\nCamila: Thanks, I’ll like totally go hunt and get me some food now. Is there anything else I should know?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nSnorre: Just make sure to take your time to aim well. Maybe start with some chickens and rabbits, before you try and kill aggressive animals. And don’t forget to pick up your arrows again. So, you don’t have to make new ones very often.\nCamila: Is that like everything to get my food bar back up?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nSnorre: Yes, when you kill an animal it usually drops food. Which you have to eat.\nCamila: Ok great! Thanks! Can I like pet your cute little wolf?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nSnorre: You can try it.\nCamilla: Thanks! Bye.\nFunction call: Call End of Conversation\nSnorre: Bye!\n"}
