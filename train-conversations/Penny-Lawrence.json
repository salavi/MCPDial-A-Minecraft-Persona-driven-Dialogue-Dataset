  "conversation": "Lawrence: Hi.\nFunction call: Call Greetings\nPenny: Hello there!\nLawrence: I heard something about a power underwater that helps breathing and mining faster.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPenny: Ah, then you probably want a conduit. It allows you to breathe underwater, mine faster, see in the night, and if big enough, also helps fend off some monsters.\nLawrence: That is what I need. Make it for me.\nFunction call: Call Find crafting recipe on Conduit\nPenny: For that, I need some Nautilus shells and a Heart of the Sea.\nLawrence: I don�t have those. Just give those to me from your chest.\nFunction call: Call Check if Nautilus Shells is in the inventory on Chest\nFunction call: Call Check if Heart of the Sea is in the inventory on Chest\nPenny: Sorry, I only have shells. Which I love to collect.\nLawrence: Great, then you can use those to make the Conduit. How do I get a Heart of the Sea?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPenny: Well, you need a Treasure Map to find a Heart of the Sea.\nLawrence: Give me one from your chest.\nFunction call: Call Check if Treasure Map is in the inventory on Chest\nPenny: You�re in luck. I do have a Treasure Map for you.\nFunction call: Call Drop item on Treasure Map\nPenny: When you go and get the Heart of the Sea, can you also get me some shells?\nLawrence: Why should I get shells, when you already have them. I�d rather use yours instead, it saves me time.\nLawrence: I got the Heart of the Sea. Make me the Conduit now.\nFunction call: Call take items from player on Heart of the Sea\nFunction call: Call craft an item on Conduit\nFunction call: Call Drop item on Conduit\nPenny: Here is the Conduit for you.\nLawrence: Good, how does this work?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPenny: Now you need to find an ocean monument or underwater ruin. You have to explore the ocean for that. You need to get Sea Lanterns, some Dark Prismarine, Some Prismarine Bricks, or Prismarine itself.\nLawrence: I have those things. What do I need to do with it?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPenny:You need to build a frame for it to work with these items. This frame needs to be built around water with the conduit in the middle. The more blocks you add to this frame, the more powerful the conduit will be.\nLawrence: Why do I want them to be more powerful?\nPenny: So their influence will be bigger, also they may help with fending off monsters.\nLawrence: That is useful. Is there anything else I need to know about conduits?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPenny: Yes, although you need water around the conduit, you can also use it outside of the sea.\nLawrence: Why would I want that?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPenny: Well, you can also mine faster within the range of a conduit. This can be useful in some situations. But do remember that you have to be wet to get the benefits.\nLawrence: How do you get wet, while not being underwater?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPenny: You can stand in the rain.\nLawrence: Fine, thanks, bye.\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nPenny: Goodbye.\n"
