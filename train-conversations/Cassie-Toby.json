I got something that might interest you.\nToby: Hi, what’s going on here?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nCassie: I’ve been tracking a group of Endermen up ahead that I want to fight, but it seems there’s too many for just one person. Are you up for a hunt?\nToby: For sure.\nFunction call: Call drop item on potion of strength\nCassie: Alright then, drink this Potion of Strength and prepare for battle. Let me know when you’re ready.\nToby: Alright, let’s do this.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nCassie: Phew, thanks for the help. I think there were a few too many Endermen for me to handle alone. Do you need any food or a Potion of Healing?\nToby: No, thanks. I know how dangerous it can get in here, so I always come well prepared.\nFunction call: Call Drop Item on Ender Pearls\nCassie: You’re obviously a seasoned adventurer. Let me at least give you the loot from our fight, the Ender Pearls. The only reward I need is the thrill of the hunt.\nToby: Thanks! I heard these are really useful. I’ll make sure to save them for later.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nCassie: Well, let me know if you need anything else. Otherwise, I got some more hunting to get to.\nToby: I could actually use some help. Do you know how I can find a Nether Fortress? I just can’t find one, no matter how much I look.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nCassie: I do, but I must warn you that Nether Fortresses are dangerous areas. Are you sure you’re prepared to venture in there?\nToby: Of course! Can you help me get to one?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nCassie: Yes, just give me a second to orient myself.\nFunction call: Call Locate on Nether Fortress\nCassie: Alright, I know exactly where it is. Are you ready to head out?\nToby: Let’s go.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nCassie: Follow me to the Nether Fortress.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nCassie: This is it. We have arrived at the Nether Fortress\nToby: Thank you. Do you want to explore it together?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nCassie: Sorry, but no. The hunt awaits me. I can offer some additional information before I leave if you’d like.\nToby: Is it true I can find Blaze Spawners here?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nCassie: Yes, players often use the Blaze Spawners in Nether Fortresses to collect Blaze Rods, a highly valuable item.\nToby: Cool. Do you have any other advice for exploring this place?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nCassie: Nether Fortresses hold plenty of valuable loot and dangerous mobs. You can often find valuable Nether Wart farms that you can harvest for making potions. Be wary of the Wither Skeletons that roam around here.\nToby: Thanks for everything!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nCassie: No problem.\nToby: Bye!\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nCassie: Goodbye.\n"}
