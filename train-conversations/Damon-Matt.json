I just want to learn how to fight. I’m having trouble defeating mobs.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nDamon: Huh. And you thought you’d just come here and get some free classes?\nMatt: I mean, yeah? This is the famous combat training ground and you’re the famous Damon, right?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nDamon: Yeah, so? First, let’s see if you’ve EARNED the right to learn. Show me your weapon.\nMatt: Here, my trusty pickaxe, it’s my weapon of choi-\nFunction call: Call nothing\nDamon: A PICKAXE?! Who the heck fights with a pickaxe?\nMatt: I’ll have you know that I have been fighting with it since day one, and\nFunction call: Call Take items from player on Pickaxe\nDamon: Gimme that, recruit.

Do you have a bow I can use?\nFunction call: Call Find crafting recipe on Bow\nDamon: Make it yourself, like this. Fighting isn’t all you have to learn. You must learn to craft, to manage your inventory, to become a true warrior.\nMatt: Right, it’s crafted now. What about arrows?\nFunction call: Call Find crafting recipe on Arrow\nDamon: Like this.

Well, here goes! HYAH!\nFunction call: Call Take items from player on Trident\nDamon: Huh! Not bad. I’ll have that back, thank you. You’re skilled with the trident. Go and fight the Drowned for one.
