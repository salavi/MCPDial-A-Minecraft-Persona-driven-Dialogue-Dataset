What a fine day for an adventure!\nOtto: Greetings to you, stranger. Who might you be?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: I am Nathan, a trader by profession and an adventurer at heart.\nOtto: A like-minded fella! So what can I do for you, Nathan?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: No, no. It’s what I can do for you. Can I interest you in a proposition? It will be worth your while.\nOtto: Oh, I am interested. But whether or not I take it up depends on my reward. What do you offer?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: I will give you that rarest of all minerals if you accept to complete a task for me.\nOtto: And what might this ‘rarest of all minerals’ be?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: Diamonds, of course. Interested?\nOtto: Save your chicanery for some other credulous oaf! As a trader, you know full well emeralds are the most valuable mineral. Diamonds don’t even come close!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: *shrugs* Guilty as charged, I’m ashamed to say. Seems I underestimated your wit. But you can’t blame a trader for trying!\nOtto: Sure I can, if they try to trick me, as you just did. My time is precious. Best of luck.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: Hang on, hang on! Sheesh, you’re a feisty one. And if I up my bid and put emeralds back on the table?\nOtto: I’m all ears.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: I will give you one emerald if you commence a raid on a nearby pillager outpost and share 50% of the spoils with me. How about it?\nOtto: ‘Emeralds’ just turned to a single ‘emerald,’ huh? You certainly have a way with words. Tell you what - I won’t undertake such a risky task for fewer than 5 emeralds.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: Five! Have a heart!\nOtto: I leave out matters of the heart when bartering with dubious characters, and I am sure you are ready to give more than what you offer.  After all, you are a trader, no?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: I am! Word of honor! How about two emeralds and a crossbow to aid you in your raid?\nOtto: Two emeralds? I can live with that. But I already have a crossbow! You could give me some diamond ore to craft a diamond sword.\nFunction call: Call drop item on diamond ore\nNathan: Here is your diamond ore.\nOtto: Now that I think about it, I need two diamond minerals to craft a diamond sword. Let me see if I have any diamond ore left in my inventory.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: So, do we have a deal?\nOtto: I’m afraid I will need another diamond ore. I’m all out!\nFunction call: Call drop item on diamond ore\nNathan: Hmm, I guess I can spare one more… Will this do?\nOtto: Perfect. Now, let me craft my sword.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: Come on pal, you’re bleeding me dry here. Will you do it?\nOtto: I will. But I still need my two emeralds!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: You get your emeralds once the task is done. You have my word!\nOtto: Your word means little to me. You tried to deceive me once. What’s stopping you from doing it again?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: A hard-boiled fella, aren’t ya? How about I give you one emerald now, and the other upon the completion of your task? Will that work?\nOtto: I sense a compromise coming. I will accept that.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nNathan: Wonderful. Now, about –\nOtto: (cuts in): But, if by any chance you renege and refuse to pay me my second emerald, I will keep the entirety of the spoils for myself and you get nothing. And I know a ton of people on this plain too.\nFunction call: Call drop item emerald\nNathan: *sighs* Guess you have me in a corner. I accept your terms.\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nNathan: Let’s do this.\n"}
