Can you help me?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nBritt: Yep, that’s me, Britt the Weapon Master!\nLouis: Ah, great. I’m having a hard time fighting mobs.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nBritt: Sorry to hear that. What weapon do you have?\nLouis: I don’t have a weapon yet.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nBritt: That explains it. Why not? Are you a pacifist or something?\nLouis: No, I, uhh… don’t know how to craft them…\nFunction call: Call Find Recipe on a wooden sword\nBritt: No problem! Pay attention, I’ll teach you the basics. First, you need to build a crafting table, like this.\nLouis: Okay, build a crafting table, and then?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nBritt: Then, since you’ll want a wooden sword to begin with, you have to craft a stick as a handle… and two planks as the blade, like this. Ta-da!\nLouis: Oh, wow. So I have to make a sword shape in the crafting table?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nBritt: Yes. A wood weapon wood’nt really help in a real fight, though! A sword can also be made from gold, stone, iron, diamond and netherite. Each material gives the sword a different attack damage and durability.\nLouis: Durability? Does that mean they can break?\nFunction call: Call open the chest. Call take items from the chest on stone sword\nBritt: Yes, but you can repair them. Here, I have a stone sword in my chest… somewhere… Ah, here it is.\nLouis: Oh wow, thanks! Now I want to build a diamond sword. I’ve heard it’s one of the strongest against mobs.\nFunction call: Call Find recipe on diamond swords\nBritt: Ah, diamond weapons. Those are powerful. To craft one, you will need the stick I mentioned and two diamonds, like this.\nLouis: Do you happen to have a diamond sword in that chest of yours as well?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nBritt: Nice try! But you can mine diamond in caves, usually at lower levels. Make sure not to spend all diamonds on weapons. They make great armor, and other amazing things!\nLouis: Noted. What other weapon types are there? I hope I don’t have to fight flying mobs with a sword!\nFunction call: Call get crafting recipe on bow\nBritt: Axes are also great melee weapons, but if you want to fight ranged enemies like Skeletons, Ghasts and Blazes, you will probably want to use a bow, crossbow or trident. Let’s make a bow for now. To craft a bow, you want to build a bow shape with sticks and string.\nLouis: Wow, it really is a bow shape. So, I’m just going to craft a bow and start fighting my enem- Wait, why are you giggling?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nBritt: Aren’t you forgetting something?\nLouis: …Arrows! Right. How to craft them?\nFunction call: Call get crafting recipe  on arrows. Call open the chest. Call take items from the chest on arrows\nBritt: Like this. Here, I’ve got five spare arrows in my chest. Take them and practice your shooting skills. Anything else?\nLouis: Nothing for now. Thanks for your help!\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nBritt: It’s okay, good luck in your hunting!\n"}
