It’s a pleasure to meet an adventurer with good taste.\nLaura: I’m Laura and I’ve recently started playing Minecraft, so I’m still learning.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nAymeric: Of course, we’re all searching for knowledge in this world! I am Aymeric, gardener and forager, and it would be my pleasure to assist you in your adventure!\nLaura: I’ve started building my base, and now I’m looking for new materials. What would you recommend?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nAymeric: Have you used stone for your base before?\nLaura: Yes, I was hoping to find something more special.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nAymeric: Then I would recommend terracota. It’s a block formed from clay, with a hardeness and blast resistance comparable to stone, only it’s a lot more stylish. Have you found any so far?\nLaura: Hm, I don’t think so... What does it look like?\nFunction call: Call Drop item on terracotta\nAymeric: Take this terracotta block.\nLaura: Oh, thanks! I haven’t seen this kind of material before.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nAymeric: Yes, because they are not so easy to find. Each biome has it’s own type, and there are 16 different colors of terracotta in this world.\nLaura: Sounds just like what I’m looking for! Where can I start searching?\nFunction call: Call locate a resource on terracota\nAymeric: Red, orange, yellow, brown, white, light gray, and uncolored terracotta can be found naturally in  , which yield massive amounts of this stylish material. Do you have access to badlands?\nLaura: No, not yet.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nAymeric: No worries, just follow me. Do you see the village?\nLaura: Yes.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nAymeric: You can look for different types of terracotta in different villages. For example, uncolored terracotta can be found in mason houses in  , and in some  village houses, lamps and meeting points. White terracotta can be found as a housing material in plains villages, yellow, orange and red terracotta in some houses in savanna villages, and lime terracotta in the mason houses of desert villages.\nLaura: Okay, got it.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nAymeric: You can also ask expert-level stone mason villagers to sell you one terracotta for the price of one emerald as part of their trades.\nLaura: I will keep that in mind. I was also wondering where can I find some pretty flowers for my base?\nFunction call: Call locate a resource on flowers.\nAymeric: Ah, my favorite question! Like terracotta, you can find different types of flowers in different biomes. For example, allium flower grows in flower forest biomes together with azure bluet and cornflower. Then there’s dandelion which grows in almost every biome, just like lilac and peony. And if you’re looking for some special flowers, I have something for you.\nLaura: Really?\nFunction call: Call Drop item on blue orcid.\nAymeric: Here, take this blue orchid. It grows only in swamp biomes, but it’s worth the effort because their bright blue bloom will take your breath away.\nLaura: It’s very pretty, I will use it to decorate my base and will search for more! Thank you so much for your help, Aymeric!\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nAymeric: You’re welcome! Stop by anytime you need some directions!\n"}
