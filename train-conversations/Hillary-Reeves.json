They don’t lack for riches, which is why they are usually interested in establishing their next big research project. This time, Hillary wants to build a network of conduits, but is lacking the materials.", "conversation": "Function call: Call Greetings\nHillary: Uhm, hello? Can I help you with something?\nReeves: I don’t know, can you?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHillary: Huh? Are you okay? Why are you grinning like you’re mad?\nReeves:  …Brains…\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHillary: What?! Guards!\nReeves: Ha-ha-ha, relax! You definitely can help me, actually.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHillary: Oookay. What can I offer you? I’ve got some of the best armor and food for miles! Although my peers also sell amazing armor; want me to connect you with someb-\nReeves: No, no. None of that. I’m not looking to buy anything. I need info.\nFunction call: Call come to the player\nHillary: What kind of info? Insider market information? I’ve got all the tips you need, at a price…\nReeves: No, and why are you whispering? I’m looking to obtain a valuable item. An… ender dragon egg. Crash-crash!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHillary: …What was that?\nReeves: Background lightning and thunder, duh. Anyway… can you help me obtain the dragon egg or not?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHillary: Sure! It’s a case of traveling to the End. That won’t be easy in itself, though. And you will need to be well equipped.\nReeves: Pshh, what for? I’m just going to travel there, steal it from the ender dragon and return.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHillary: …HA! Tell me this is another joke!\nReeves: No, I’m actually being serious this time (for once)…\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHillary: Sigh. Impossible – you need to defeat the ender dragon to obtain an ender dragon egg, buddy. And you do know how to build a portal that takes you there, right?\nReeves: I… I… not really.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHillary: Hmph. Right, I may be able to help, if you can help me. I have a mission of my own, to build a network of conduits. But for that, I need a valuable item as well.\nReeves: I see. What item may that be?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHillary: Heart of the Sea. Have you heard of it? If you could bring me… three? Is three okay? I would tell you anything for that.\nReeves: Three is my lucky number! No – wait… it was four. Close enough. Where can I find them?\nFunction call: Call drop item on explorer map\nHillary: It’s rare like your egg, so there’s only one way to obtain them: in Buried Treasure. You can find these in beaches and sometimes on the ocean floor. Explorer maps help. Here’s one, so you can get started.\nReeves: Oh, appreciated! Time to hunt some hearts! …of the Sea, I mean.\nFunction call: Call take items from player on three hearts of the sea\nHillary: Already back? Impressive, I imagine you made quite an effort!\nReeves: Yes, I really hope it can help you. Now… time for that EGG-celent information you promised!\nFunction call: Call locate a block on end portal block\nHillary: “Egg-celent”?! Okay, so let me help you. Firstly, you need to locate an end portal and activate it. But since I’m being nice, here’s the location to one.\nReeves: Ooh, thanks! Not like it cost me three hearts of the sea or anything!\nFunction call: Call get recipe on eyes of ender\nHillary: Heh heh, fine. Then you need to fill the empty portal blocks with eyes of ender. You can craft these with blaze powder and ender pearls. You’re going to need to kill endermen.\nReeves: Yikes. Just my luck.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHillary: Finally, go through the portal and defeat the ender dragon. The egg will spawn once it’s defeated. But you need some equipment. Gear up and take some friends, it’s going to be a tough fight.\nReeves: Fine, let me think about it. Thanks for everything! Good luck with your project!\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nHillary: Likewiseee!\n"}
