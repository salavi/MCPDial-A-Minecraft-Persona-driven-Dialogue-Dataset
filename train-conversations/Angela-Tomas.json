Player has entered her laboratory to find Angela with her back turned, mixing potions at a Brewing Stand.", "conversation": "Tomas: Hello. Are you Angela?\nFunction call: Call Greetings\nAngela: I am Angela. Who’s asking?\nTomas: I am Tomas, an adventurer. I am trying to learn all I can about survival.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nAngela: A noble pursuit. But why tell me?\nTomas: I heard you were an expert at brewing potions. I figured I’d need them for my quest.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nAngela: Hmph. Let me get a look at you.\nFunction call: Call come to the player\nAngela: Eh, you might have some potential. Are you good with a Brewing Stand?\nTomas: Not really. I think I need to get a grasp on the basics.\nAngel: Indeed. Fine. First lesson: nothing is free. You help me, and I’ll help you.\nTomas: Okay. Where do we start?\nFunction call: Call\nAngela: As you said, we start with the basics. The first thing you’ll need is an empty bottle.\nFunction call: Call find Recipe on glass bottles. Call drop items on glass\nAngela: Use my Brewing Stand for now, but you’ll need to make your own at some point. Use this recipe to make 3 bottles.\nTomas: Got it.\nFunction call: Call locate a resource on well\nAngela: Suitable. Now, like all liquids, potions need water. Return to me when you’ve filled the 3 bottles with water. There is a well outside.\nTomas: 3 water bottles, as requested.\nFunction call: Call take items form player on 2 water bottles\nAngela: These will do. I’ve taken 2 bottles for my services.\nTomas: Okay, done.\nFunction call: Call Find Recipe on Blaze Powders\nAngela: Now we’ll make a base potion. All potions need a base. For that, we need a heat source called Blaze Powder. These are made from Blaze Rods, which drop from a monster called a Blaze in the Nether. The Nether is the best place to gather the basic brewing ingredients.\nTomas: Unfortunately, I don’t have any blaze rods.\nFunction call: Call drop item on Blaze Rods.\nAngela: For now, use mine. Next, grab the Nether Wart and Glistering Melon out of the chest over there, and then meet me back at the Brewing Stand.\nTomas: Alright.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nAngela: Good. Now we’ll make a base potion, since all potions start with a base. You place the water bottle in one of the slots at the bottom, the Nether Wart at the very top, and finally, the Blaze Powder in the fire-looking slot on the left. The Blaze Powder activates the brewing process, so do it last. The result is called an Awkward Potion, so named because it does nothing, which is awkward if you’re trying to show off your potion-making skills.\nTomas: Ha, I get it. There has to be more to this, right?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nAngela: Of course there is. The fun part: adding an active ingredient. This is why you grabbed the Glistering Melon earlier. Repeat the same process as before, except replace the Water Bottles with the Awkward Potion, and put the Glistering Melon at the top instead of the Nether Wart. Use the other Blaze Powder you made earlier to ignite the Brewing Stand.\nFunction call: Call Drop Item on Potion of Health. Call get recipe on Potion of Health.\nAngela: This Potion of Health should help when you search the Nether for more ingredients. And this recipe will help you create your very own Brewing Stand!\nTomas: Awesome, thanks!\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nAngela: You can thank me by telling everyone you meet about my shop. Good luck, adventurer.\n"}
