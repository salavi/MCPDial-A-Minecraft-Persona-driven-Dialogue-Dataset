His friends who play Minecraft told him the woodland mansion holds many weapons, and he is eager to find out for himself.

He prefers searching for it.", "scene": "Gale wanders around the oceans.", "conversation": "Daymond: Hi there.\nFunction call: Call Greetings\nGale: Hello!\nDaymond: I’ve heard you can find a lot of weapons in a woodland mansion. Is this true?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nGale: Ah yes, a woodland mansion holds great riches for those brave enough to raid one. What is it you’d like to know about them?\nDaymond: What do you mean “brave enough to raid one”. Isn’t it just a mansion?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nGale: Ah no, it isn’t “just” a mansion. It is heavily guarded.\nDaymond: So, when do I know if I can go to one to get the weapons?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nGale: I can check if you are ready for a couple of emeralds.\nDaymond: No, I’ll figure it out myself. Where can I find a woodland mansion?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nGale: In general, you can find one via a woodland explorer map, I do have one on me. For three emeralds it is all yours.\nDaymond: I don’t need a map, I want to know where they are in general.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nGale: Ah, you can find them in dark forests.\nDaymond: Thanks, is there anything I should know about the guards that are there?\nGale: If you give me an emerald, I’ll tell you all about what you can expect.\nDaymond: Ugh... Fine, one emerald.\nFunction call: Call take items from player on Emerald\nGale: Thank you very much. So, you’ll usually find Evokers and Vindicators within a woodland mansion. The problem is that the rooms are relatively small. So, it is better to have a weapon for close combat to fight them. A couple of hits with a good sword should help you out.\nDaymond: I have this beautiful golden sword, I think I should be fine with that.\nFunction call: Call Check if item is in the inventory on Iron Sword\nGale: A while a golden sword indeed is beautiful, it isn’t really useful. You can better use that iron sword you have there. It’ll last longer and hurts them more.\nDaymond: That was actually useful. Thanks.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nGale: You’re welcome, also don’t forget to leave anything you don’t need behind before you go looking for a mansion.\nDaymond: And why would that be?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nGale: As I said, there are a lot of riches to be found in a woodland mansion. The more you leave behind, the more you can bring with you from the woodland mansion.\nDaymond: Oke thanks a lot for this information!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nGale: No problem, and thanks for the emerald. Anything else you want to know?\nDaymond: No thanks, I think I have everything I need. I’ll go and find a woodland mansion now.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nGale: Good luck!\nDaymond: Bye.\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nGale: Goodbye!\n"}
