I’m waiting for my turn to ride the rollercoaster!\nMartin: Wait, there are rollercoasters in there?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nLewis: I wish son, but no, there are spiders inside though,\nMartin: Ew! I’m scared of those critters! How can I fight them?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nLewis: By singing them to sleep.\nMartin: You are joking again, aren't you?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nLewis: Clever lad, you can fight them with swords up close.\nMartin: But, I don’t want to get close to them!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nLewis: You can use a bow then.\nMartin: I… I don’t know how to make one.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nLewis: All you need to do is bend, and you are bowing to the spider lords.\nMartin: I don’t understand, why would I do that?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nLewis: Never mind, I can teach you how to make a bow.\nMartin: How! Please tell me! I want to shoot spiders.\nFunction call: Call Find crafting recipe on Bow\nLewis: To make a bow, you’ll need 3 sticks and strings each. That’s it!\nMartin: Where can I find these?\nFunction call: Call find recipe on Planks.\nLewis: You can get sticks by combining any two planks.\nMartin: What about strings?\nFunction call: Call find recipe on the String.\nLewis: You get strings from cobwebs. You can get them from other places as well, so always be on the lookout.\nMartin: I have so many planks, but I don’t have any strings.\nFunction call: Call Block Mine on Cobweb,\nLewis: Don’t worry, kiddo, I’ll get you some strings from cobwebs inside the mine. You only need one cobweb to make a string.\nMartin: You would? You are a lifesaver, mister!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nLewis: Here you go, some fresh strings. Now give me those planks and I’ll craft you a bow!\nMartin: Woah! That was fast! Here they are.\nFunction call: Call Craft item on Bow. Call Drop item function on Bow.\nLewis: I’ll just combine these and get you a shiny new bow.\nMartin: Yes! Thanks, for the bow! Now I can shoot scary monsters from far away!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nLewis: Not so fast, buddy, you still need arrows.\nMartin: Aww, I don’t have any!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nLewis: No problem, I have plenty of them. I can share a few with you.\nMartin: No way! Why would you do that?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nLewis: Because I’m a gullible guy that gives away his stuff for free.\nMartin: You are back to joking again? I don’t get it, you seem smart to me!\nFunction call: Call Drop item on Arrow\nLewis: You are a bright boy, here are 12 arrows. You can always pick them back up after shooting, these are enough to get you started.\nMartin: What if I run out of them?\nFunction call: Call Find crafting recipe on the Arrow.\nLewis: Well, kiddo, you can combine Flint, Stick, and a Feather to make 4 new Arrows!\nMartin: I’ll make sure to remember that! Thanks again for your help, mister!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nLewis: Me? Help you? Nah, Nah, you helped me by giving a valuable life lesson.\nMartin: Really? What was it?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nLewis: That I shouldn’t stand outside abandoned mines and give away free arrows.\nMartin: I don’t get it at all, I thought I helped you.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nLewis: Don’t worry, buddy, you’ll get it when you get older. Until then, have great adventures!\nMartin: OK mister! I got to go now, bye!\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nLewis: Ah, off you go! Safe travels and goodbye!\n"}
