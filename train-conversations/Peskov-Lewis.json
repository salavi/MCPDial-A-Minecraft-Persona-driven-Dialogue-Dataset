He is excited about fighting hostile parties but ignores the NPC's conversation as he fights using a wooden sword till his food bar runs out. He becomes rude to the NPC for no justifiable reason.", "scene": "Lewis is roaming around fighting whatever mobs they can find out in the world. Peskov approaches the player as they are fighting a group of enemies.", "conversation": "Player name: Lewis\nFunction call: Call Greetings\nPeskov: Well, well, it looks like we have a warrior here!\nLewis: Huh?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPeskov: I�m known by Peskov around these parts, and I�m a renowned master of combat. I can tell you have potential in you, adventurer.\nLewis: I�m busy, leave me alone.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPeskov: Very well then, I�ll be here if you change your mind.\nLewis: Hey, you there.\nFunction call: Call Drop Item on Torch\nPeskov: Ah, I see you�ve come back to hear more. I like to give newbie adventurers like you some resources to help them in their journey. Take these Torches.\nLewis: I�m not a newbie, but whatever. My health is not regenerating, do you know what�s up with that?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPeskov: Of course. You don�t become a master of combat without learning some useful things. Do you want me to teach you about health regeneration?\nLewis: Yes, can we go through this any faster?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPeskov: I�ll make it simple for you. In order for your health to regenerate, you�ll have to consume food so that your hunger bar can fill up and trigger the health regeneration effect.\nLewis: What makes you think I need the simple version? I�m a chess prodigy, if you must know.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPeskov: Would you like me to go more into detail about how regeneration works?\nLewis: Just forget about it, tell me how to get food.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPeskov: Well, there are many ways to find food out in the world. You can farm crops, kill animals, find it in chests, or even craft it from certain ingredients.\nLewis: How about you just give me some food?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPeskov: Ha! I wouldn�t be teaching a newbie like you much if I just gave you everything you need. What do you think about taking on a quest?\nLewis: STOP CALLING ME NEWBIE! I COULD DESTROY YOU IN CHESS WITH MY EYES CLOSED!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPeskov: I don�t understand, do you wish to take on my quest or not?\nLewis: Okay yes, just tell me what you need�\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPeskov: In exchange for a single Spruce Log, I shall prepare you a hearthy Rabbit Stew. Deal?\nLewis: Okay I actually have one in my inventory, how do I give it to you?\nFunction call: Call Take Item from Player on Spruce Log\nPeskov: I�ll be having that! You ready for your nutritious reward?\nLewis: Yes, just hurry it up. I want less talk and more fight.\nFunction call: Call Drop Item on Rabbit Stew\nPeskov: There you go. A single Rabbit Stew for a hungry adventurer. Have at it!\nLewis: I ate it and I�m still hungry. Do you have more?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nPeskov: It�s on you to figure it out from here on out. This world can be unforgiving at times. Can I answer any more questions?\nLewis: Ugh, you suck. I�m going to leave now.\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nPeskov: Good luck and goodbye!\nLewis: Whatever.\n"}
