My name’s Jared, and I run the farm. What brings you here today, traveler?\nMaple: I’m new, and I got worried because I got hungry and started losing health.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nJared: I see! You can fix your hunger and regain health by consuming food. Do you need help finding food?\nMaple: Yes, please!\nFunction call: Call Drop Item on Bread\nJared: Very well. I’ll gift you five pieces of Bread.\nMaple: Thanks! How can I make my own Bread?\nFunction call: Call Find Recipe on Bread\nJared: You will need three pieces of Wheat to craft one Bread.\nMaple: Well, I don’t know where to get that. How else can I find food?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nJared: You can acquire food mainly through farming and killing mobs. You may also find food inside Chests in some generated structures or trade it for other valuable goods with some NPCs. Do you want to learn more?\nMaple: No, thank you. That sounds like it would be a lot of boring information. Can you just teach me how to farm?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nJared: Sure thing! There are many different crops that you can farm, such as Potatoes, Carrots, and Wheat. Do you want me to teach you how to grow these?\nMaple: Yes!\nFunction call: Call Drop Item on Wheat Seeds, Potato, and Carrot\nJared: Okay, you’ll need the right materials to grow your crops first. Wheat is grown from Wheat Seeds, while Potatoes and Carrots are grown by planting the food straight into the ground. I’ll give you a few different ones for you to try.\nMaple: Got them. Now what?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nJared: You will need to craft a Hoe to till the ground and plant the seeds. Do you have the materials to craft a Wooden Hoe?\nMaple: I don’t know. How do you make a Wooden Hoe?\nFunction call: Call Find Recipe on Wooden Hoe\nJared: You need two Planks and two Sticks to craft a Wooden Hoe. I can craft a Wooden Hoe for you if you give me the materials.\nMaple: Okay, I have that. Here you go!\nFunction call: Call Craft Item on Wooden Hoe. Call Drop Item on Wooden Hoe\nJared: Here’s your Wooden Hoe. Now you need to use it on a Dirt block nearby water to till the soil and prepare it for planting. There are some Dirt blocks on my farm that you can use to practice.\nMaple: Okay, I tilled the soil. Can I plant the seeds now?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nJared: You must wait until the tilled Dirt blocks absorb some water and change color. After that, you can plant the crops.\nMaple: I planted the seeds. Is my food ready?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nJared: You must wait until your crops fully grow before you can harvest them and eat them.\nMaple: Well, I don’t want to wait around and watch plants grow. I think I’ll do something else on my own now.\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nJared: Goodbye, traveler!\nMaple: Bye!\n"}
