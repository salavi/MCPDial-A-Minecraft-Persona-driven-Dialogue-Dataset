He has a pen of sheep.", "conversation": "Function call: Call Greetings\nHenry: Hello there! I’m Henry. I live in this village.\nMichael: Hi Henry. My name is Michael.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: What brings you here?\nMichael: I was just in the rainforest. I was looking for a parrot there, but they are hard to find. I want one so bad.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: They are a rare find. If you manage to tame a parrot, they perform interesting tricks.\nMichael: It sounds like you have seen them before.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: I have. I go to the rainforest often. It’s where I found my sheep!\nMichael: Could you tell me how to find a parrot? They’re such beautiful birds.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: I would, but I am busy. I am trying to finish a log cabin today, and I am running out of materials.\nMichael: Oh, that’s a shame.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: I’ll have time to talk about parrots if you help me acquire more materials to finish the job.\nMichael: What an opportunist move. How insulting!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: Time is precious, Michael.\nMichael: I know, so why don’t you value mine, fool?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: If you have 20 oak to give me, we could find ourselves on equal ground.\nMichael: This is ridiculous. I don’t have any!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: I’ll be here until you do.\nMichael: Here are all of your requested oak.\nFunction call: Call take items from player on oaks. Call locate a resource on parrots.\nHenry: Thank you. If you want to find a parrot, you have to look for logs and leaves at very high altitudes in the rainforest.\nMichael: Good to know. I was not traveling high enough.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: There is no guarantee you will get one, though, if you are unprepared.\nMichael: I am always prepared when acquiring animals!\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: If you give me 30 spruce to finish this porch, I will give you something that parrots love.\nMichael: Are you this greedy with everyone, or just me?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: I promise we will both win big if you offer me 30 spruce.\nMichael: Ugh, I have to get some.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: I’ll be here until you do.\nMichael: Here are 30 spruce.\nFunction call: Call Take Item on spruce. Call drop items on beetroot seeds.\nHenry: Fantastic. Here is a gift of 20 beetroot seeds.\nMichael: Beetroot seeds? What am I supposed to do with these?\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: When you find a parrot, seeds are the best way for them to trust you. They like melon, wheat, and pumpkin. Nothing is certain with parrots, but this should get the process started.\nMichael: Oh, thank you.\nFunction call: Call nothing\nHenry: I ask little of most people. I wanted to make sure you have patience and respect for others. This is what parrots will ask of you.\nMichael: You offer up great insight. I hope your cabin shapes up nice. I’ll be on my way.\nFunction call: Call End Conversation\nHenry: Thank you. Best of luck, Michael.\n"}
